# ✅ Todo REST API Documentation

👋 Welcome to the documentation for the Todo REST API! This API allows you to manage a collection of todos. You can perform operations like retrieving all todos, retrieving a specific todo by its ID, updating a todo, and deleting a todo. The API is built using Node.js and is hosted on GitHub. Let's dive into the details of how to use this API effectively.

## 🚀 Features

### Retrieve all todos
```
GET /api/todo
```
This endpoint returns a list of all todos. It does not require any parameters.

### Retrieve a specific todo
```

```
Replace **`{id}`** with the ID of the todo you want to retrieve. This endpoint returns a single todo object.

### Update a todo
